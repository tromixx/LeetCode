**Definition:** A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.  
**Use Case:** Used in breadth-first search (BFS), scheduling problems, and producer-consumer scenarios.

### 8. Binary Search Tree
**Definition:** A tree data structure where the left subtree contains values smaller than the root, and the right contains greater values.  
**Use Case:** Used in fast searching, range queries, and self-balancing trees like AVL and Red-Black trees.

### 9. Heap / Priority Queue
**Definition:** A binary tree-based structure that always keeps the minimum or maximum element at the root.  
**Use Case:** Used in scheduling tasks, Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm, and real-time processing.

### 10. Graphs - BFS
**Definition:** A breadth-first traversal of graphs, visiting all neighbors before moving to the next level.  
**Use Case:** Used in shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra‚Äôs), network flow, and social network analysis.

### 11. Graphs - DFS
**Definition:** A depth-first search traversal of graphs, visiting nodes recursively before backtracking.  
**Use Case:** Used in pathfinding, cycle detection, and connected components detection.

### 12. Binary Tree - BFS
**Definition:** A tree traversal algorithm that explores all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level.  
**Use Case:** Used in shortest path algorithms, level-order traversal, and scheduling problems.

### 13. Binary Tree - DFS
**Definition:** A tree traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.  
**Use Case:** Used in tree-based searching, backtracking, and pathfinding algorithms.

### 14. Backtracking
**Definition:** A recursive approach that explores all possibilities but backtracks when a solution fails.  
**Use Case:** Used in solving puzzles (Sudoku), permutations, and constraint satisfaction problems.

### 15. DP - 10
**Definition:** A dynamic programming technique solving a problem using a **1D array** to store results of subproblems.  
**Use Case:** Used in Fibonacci sequences, climbing stairs, and knapsack problems.

### 16. DP - Multidimensional
**Definition:** A DP approach where multiple states (dimensions) are used to store intermediate results.  
**Use Case:** Used in problems involving grids, sequences (LCS, LIS), and matrix chain multiplication.

### 17. Trie
**Definition:** A tree-like data structure used to store strings efficiently for fast lookup.  
**Use Case:** Used in autocomplete, dictionary implementation, and substring searching.

### 18. Bit Manipulation
**Definition:** An approach that performs operations at the bit level for efficient computations.  
**Use Case:** Used in toggling bits, checking odd/even, and solving XOR-based problems.

### 19. Array / String
**Definition:** An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations, while a string is a sequence of characters stored as an array.  
**Use Case:** Used for problems involving sequential data storage, searching, sorting, and manipulation.

### 20. Linked List
**Definition:** A sequential data structure where each element (node) points to the next node.  
**Use Case:** Used for dynamic memory allocation, implementing stacks/queues, and handling cases where frequent insertions/deletions are needed.

### 21. Monotonic Stack
**Definition:** A stack where elements are stored in a strictly increasing or decreasing order.  
**Use Case:** Used in finding the next greater element, histogram problems, and stock span problems.

### 22. Intervals
**Definition:** Problems where a range (interval) is given, and operations like merging, sorting, or searching are performed.  
**Use Case:** Used in scheduling problems, meeting room allocations, and overlapping intervals.
